Instuctions for working with the Lightspark testsuite

Installing Flex
----------------

In order to build SWF files from ActionScript sources you need an AS3 compiler
One comes with the Flex SDK and it is recommended you install it if you plan
on running the tests and doing development.

Get Flex 4.1 Update.

Follow the installation instuctions within, then check whether it is installed correctly

$mxmlc --version
Version 4.1.0 build 16076

Installing the Adobe player
---------------------------
In order to get a known good Flash player to compare results against and
test SFW files with you can download the free as in beer Adobe player.

Download the Projector content debugger and unpack it somewhere in your $PATH.

Check if it is installed by running

$flashplayerdebugger --version
10,3,183,7

Running the Tamarin testsuite
-----------------------------

cd tests

One time setup and build of the tests

hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/tamarin-redux tamarin
wget ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/js/tamarin/builds/asc/latest/asc.jar
./make-tamarin

Run the entire suite
./tests

Run the entire suite using the Adobe player - everything should pass
./tests -p

Running the testsuite can take a long time and each test pops up a temporary window.
In order to run the suite headless and not steal focus from other applications run

xvfb-run -s '-extension GLX' -a ./tests

You need to have Xvfb installed (apt-get install xvfb or similar)
