Steps used to make a new release
=================================

Here's what was used to release 0.5.2. In the future slight changes will be needed to adjust for the version numbers

Make the tarball
-------------------

Make sure all supported sites work and there are no regressions.

When you consider the tree good to release and have the changelog updated go to a git checkout

$cd lightspark

Bump version in CMakeLists.txt and commit the change

tag it

$git tag lightspark-0.5.2
$git push --tags origin master

make a tarball of it

$git archive --format tar --prefix=lightspark-0.5.2/ lightspark-0.5.2 |gzip -9 >../lightspark-0.5.2.tar.gz

sign the tarball for publishing on Launchpad
$gpg --armor --sign --detach-sig lightspark-0.5.2.tar.gz

Bump debian/changelog version as that is used by the daily Ubuntu package builds in Launchpad.
$dch -i

Upload to Launchpad
--------------------

Currently only available to project managers (Alessandro and Jani).

Create milestone and release in this interface, name both lightspark-0.5.2
